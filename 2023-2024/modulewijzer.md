## 1. General description

Functional programming and functional programming languages are increasing in popularity for multiple
reasons and in multiple ways, to the point that even mainstream languages such as Python, C++, C#,
and Java are being extended with more and more functional programming features such as tuples,
lambda’s, higher order functions, and even monads such as LINQ and async/await. Whole architectures
such as the popular map/reduce are strongly inspired by functional programming.

> “Java developers should learn functional paradigms now, even if they have no immediate plans to move to a functional language such as Scala or Clojure. Over time, all mainstream languages will become more functional” [IBM].

> “LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have
when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days,
even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot.” – Eric S. Raymond

> “SQL, Lisp, and Haskell are the only programming languages that I’ve seen where one spends more time
thinking than typing.” – Philip Greenspun

>“I do not know if learning Haskell will get you a job. I know it will make you a better software developer.” - Larry O’ Brien

The reason for this growth is to be found in the safe and deep expressive power of functional languages, which are capable of recombining simpler elements into powerful, complex other elements with less space for mistakes and more control in the hands of the programmer. This comes at a fundamental cost: functional languages are structurally different from imperative and object oriented languages, and thus a new mindset is required of the programmer that wishes to enter this new world. Moreover, functional languages often require more thought and planning, and are thus experienced, especially by beginners,
as somewhat less flexible and supporting of experimentation.

### 1.1 Relationship with other didactic units and required knowledge

This module completes and perfects the understanding and knowledge of programming that was set up
in the Development courses of the first year. The preliminary knowledge necessary to fully understand
this course covers the following topics:

- Semantics of programming languages and its evaluation.
- The memory model ofStackandHeap.
- Type systemsand type checking.
- Dynamic vs Static typing.

## 2. Course program

The course topics are divided in 5 conceptual units, not necessarily in a one-to-one correspondance with the course weeks, which are seven.

### Unit 1

- Stateful vs stateless computation
- Lambda calculus semantics.
- Variables
- Lambda-abstractions/functions
- Function application
- Introduction to typescript

### Unit 2

- Typed lambda calculus. Typing variables, lambda abstractions, function applications.
- Basic data structures in typescript
- Structural equality.

### Unit 3

- Polymorhpism in functional programming
- Discriminated unions.
- Pattern matching.

### Unit 4

- Higher-order functions.
- Function composition.
- HOF design patterns.

### Unit 5

- Hierarchical advanced data structures.
- Immutable trees.
- Immutable binary search trees.
- Decision trees.
- Graphs.

## 3. Assessment

The course is tested with an exam consisting of two parts: a theory part and a practical part. The
theory part happens on paper while you can use your laptop in the practical one. Both parts result in a
single grade. This means that partial grades on each part are not kept.

### 3.1 Practical examination INFADP01-D/INFADP21-D

The practical exam requires to implement a series of functions (described in the exam text) in the
language typescript. The practical examination contains a question on each learning unit (simple recursion,
recursion with basic data structures, polymorphism, higher-order design patterns, and advanced data
structures). During the practical examination you are allowed to use your laptop.

**3.1.1 Important**

For the practical part, you will be provided with a solution template that contains an automatic checker
as a pre-compiled library. This checker will tell you in any moment which exercises are correct and your
score. In order to compile and run this template, you need .NET 6.0, so be sure that everything is set
up correctly on your machine before the exam. You can test if everything works in advance by compiling
and running one of the sample exams.

### 3.2 Note for retakers

The retakers of the old INFDEV02-8 (Development 8) and functional programming (INFFPR01-D/21-
D) must repeat the whole exam because now the system records just a single grade. This means that if
you passed partially the theory or practice of either Development 8 or INFFPR01-D/21-D you need to
repeat the whole exam.
